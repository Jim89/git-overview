# An Introduction to Git

This repository stores the source documents for materials developed for a
learning session title _An Introduction to Git_.

The aim of the session is to give an overview of what Git is, what it's useful
for within the context of a data science project (i.e. not specific to software
development), and then some details of _how_ to use Git for simple day-to-day
tasks (add, commit, push/pull etc).
