## Installing `git`

`git` can be downloaded and installed on to your machine from its
[website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

On Windows, this will install `git`, and `git bash`, a command-line environment
for working with `git`.

All `git` commands/processes can be executed directly from the command line. But
it is often a bit nicer (especially for beginners) to use a graphical tool.

## Installing Source Tree

Atlassian Source Tree is a nice way to interact with a `git` repository using a
GUI (and will be shown in the session). You can download it
[here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

To use SourceTree you will need to register an account with Atlassian. An
account is free, and doesn't mean you will be sending any code to Atlassian. You
can register for an account during installation, or ahead of time
[here](https://id.atlassian.com/signup).
