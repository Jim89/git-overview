## In this session

* An overview of `git`
* How to `git`

<aside class="notes">
* Start with an overview of git, what is is, why it is
    * 30-40 mins
    * Break
* Git how-to. Technical, hands on. 
  * All installed git?
  * All installed SourceTree?
</aside>

<aside class="notes">
* git is a system for version control
* vc?
  * ever created _v2, _v3, _vfinal, _vfinalfinal?
  * you have done vc
* git automates that, and more

> [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) - Jenny Bryan, UBC

## What is `git`?

* Free
* Built for collaboration
* Distributed

<aside class="notes">
* Free as in Â£, free as in open source
* Collaborative - enables many people to work on the same project code
* Distributed - every "developer" has a complete history of the code
* Not just for code, anything that is _stored as_ text (e.g. Markdown not Word!)
can be controlled
</aside>

## What is `git` for us?

* "Track changes on steroids" (Jenny Bryan)
* Clear audit trail
* Minimise confusion

<aside class="notes">
* clear log of _every_ change on a project
    * go back and forward in time
    * get the code at a specific point in time
* View changes, comment on changes, accept/reject/merge
* Tools for collaboration, easily get your colleagues work, review it, change
it, enhance it etc
</aside>

## The `git` log

```{r ggkpmg-log}
ggkpmg <- readr::read_tsv("./ggkpmg/ggkpmg-log.tsv", col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  set_names(c("commit_id", "author", "datetime", "message")) %>% 
  mutate(datetime = gsub("\\ \\+[0-9]+", "", datetime)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

knitr::kable(head(ggkpmg))
```

A history of _every_ change made to the code.

<aside class="notes">
* Each change/set of related changes is saved as a _commit_
* Each commit has an ID
* We can use the ID to go backwards and forwards in time
* Each commit stores a set of _changes_ to a file
</aside>

## Tracking changes with `git`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./www/commit-diff.png")
```

* Makes reviewing code very easy

<aside class="notes">
* Red = removed; green = added
* git will summarise one, or a thousand files
</aside>
    
## Case study - Project Osbourne

```{r get-logs, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# List out all files to be read in
files_dir <- list.files("./logs", pattern = ".tsv", full.names = T)
files <- gsub(".tsv", "", list.files("./logs", pattern = ".tsv"))

# Define function to read commit tsv (weird formatting prevents read_tsv)
read_commits <- function(commits_data, data_name) {
  readr::read_lines(commits_data) %>% 
    map(stringr::str_split, '\t') %>% 
    map(`[[`, 1) %>% 
    map(t) %>% 
    map(as_tibble) %>% 
    bind_rows() %>% 
    set_names(c("commit", "author", "datetime", "comment")) %>% 
    mutate(version = data_name)
}  

# Read in data
commits <- map2(files_dir, files, read_commits) %>% # Read in
  bind_rows()  # Collapse in to single table

commits_cln <- commits %>% 
  extract(version, "version_number", regex = "([[0-9]]+)", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(datetime = gsub("\\ \\+0000", "", datetime),
         datetime = ymd_hms(datetime),
         date = date(datetime),
         hour = hour(ceiling_date(datetime, unit = "hours")),
         day = wday(date, label = T, abbr = F),
         version_number = as.numeric(version_number),
         author = if_else(author == "Sara young", "Sara Young", author),
         author = if_else(author == "unknown", "Unknown", author)) %>%
  group_by(commit) %>% 
  mutate(earliest_version = min(version_number)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(version_number == earliest_version) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(datetime) %>% 
  separate(version, c("label", "ver"), "_") %>% 
  select(-label) %>% 
  filter(version_number <=  9) %>% 
  mutate(ver = forcats::fct_reorder(ver, datetime, min))
```

* Regulatory calculation/remediation

<br>

* Major UK retailer

<br>

* Vague delivery objectives

<aside class="notes">
* Vauge = understood main objective, but not _exactly_ what we needed to deliver
* In other words, a fairly typical project (based on my experiences)
</aside>

## Project Osbourne

* Very messy data

<br>

* Dynamic requirements

<br>

* Tight deadlines

<aside class="notes">
* Lots of messy data
* Cleaning rules importan
    * interpretation of codes in fields could have major impact
* Calculation logic evolved (rapidly) iterated over the the course of the project
    * And impact of changes needed
</aside>

## Project Osbourne

* Clear audit trails

<br>

* Code and work-product collaboration

<br>

* Strict version control

<aside class="notes">
* Needed a clear trail of what had happened
    * What code produced what numbers?
    * What was the impact to a change in calc logic
* 4-5 team members all needed to read, write, and collaborate on code
* Need to maintain strict versions to reproduce later
</aside>

## Commits vs time

```{r commits_vs_day, cache = TRUE}
commits_cln %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(commits = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, commits)) +
  geom_line(colour = kpmgcolours("primary")[1], size = 1.25) +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Commits",
       title = "Total commits per date",
       subtitle = "A single commit can represent dozens of changes across multiple code files") +
  theme_kpmg()
```

<aside class="notes">
* Here's an overview of commits per day
* We were busiest in late Jan and Feb
* But what this doesn't show is the changing between versions
</aside>

## Versions over time

```{r commit_versions_vs_date, cache = TRUE}
commits_cln %>% 
  group_by(version_number, date) %>% 
  summarise(commits = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, commits)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = as.factor(version_number)), size = 1.25) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = unname(kpmgcolours("graphs")[1:9])) +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Commits",
       title = "Total commits per date, per build version",
       subtitle = "Some versions overlapped as we switched back and forth\nbetween different calculation logics") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Build version", nrow = 2, byrow = T)) +
  theme_kpmg() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<aside class="notes">
* Each version of the code had slightly different rules/code
* Each "version" ~200 code files with logic for data cleaning, calculations, test suites etc
* git let us manage all those versions
* easily jump between them, compare results, asses the impact of changes to script logic
</aside>

## `git` hosting

```{r show_bb}
knitr::include_graphics("www/bb.png")
```

<aside class="notes">
* Lots of servies offering git _hosting_
* I.e. store a repository on the (private) web
* Within KPMG we use BitBucket - an Atlassian product
* Available through CloudOps in Lighthouse
</aside>

## `git` hosting

```{r show_bb2}
knitr::include_graphics("www/bb2.png")
```

<aside class="notes">
* Eeasy way for project overview, without local code
* Restrict access on a project-by-project basis
* Integrates with markdown
* Several related products, e.g. Jira and Confluence (also Atlassian) to give us full PM side of work
    * Jira: to do lists, issues, tasks etc
    * Confluence: documentation, articles, longer-form project
</aside>

## `git` for me

```{r gh}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gh.png")
```

<aside class="notes">
* GitHub != `git`. _GitHub_ is just another git hosting service
    * I don't pay, so it's public, but there are also paid private/enterprise versions
* I use it for tracking progress of personal projects
    * E.g. work from MSc
    * Personal blog, little projects etc
* Others use it to release software (e.g. the software I wrote the presentation with!)
