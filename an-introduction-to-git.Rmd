## What is `git`?

* Free
* Built for collaboration
* Distributed

<aside class="notes">
* Free as in Â£, free as in open source
* Collaborative - enables many people to work on the same project code
* Distributed - every "developer" has a complete history of the code
* Not just for code, anything that is _stored as_ text (e.g. Markdown not Word!)
can be controlled
</aside>

## What is `git` for us?

* "Track changes on steroids" (Jenny Bryan)
* Clear audit trail
* Minimise confusion

<aside class="notes">
* clear log of _every_ change on a project
    * go back and forward in time
    * get the code at a specific point in time
* View changes, comment on changes, accept/reject/merge
* Tools for collaboration, easily get your colleagues work, review it, change
it, enhance it etc
