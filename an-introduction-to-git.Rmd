## In this session

* An overview of `git`
* How to `git`

<br>

<aside class="notes">
* Start with an overview of git, what is is, why it is
    * 30-40 mins
    * Break
* Git how-to. Technical, hands on. 
  * All installed git?
  * All installed SourceTree?
</aside>

## Who am I?

* Started at KPMG in 2012
* Early career as a data analyst
* Self study, then MSc Data Science
* Transferred to data scientist post-MSc
* `r as.numeric(ceiling(difftime(Sys.Date(), as.Date("2013-01-01"), units = "days")/365))` years using (and sometimes teaching) `git`

# An overview of `git`

## What is `git`?

![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Joke is that "no one" really knows what it is, just how to use/break it
* This is how most people (including me!) come to learn about `git`
* Hope today we will explain what `git` does, and how to use
* developed to help manage the (whole) linux kernel
* Similar to SVN/Microsoft TFS
* git is a system for:
    * collaboration
    * management
    * version control
</aside>

## Version control?

> In collaborative settings based on email distribution, the original file swiftly becomes part of a complicated phylogeny that no amount of "Track Changes" and good intentions can resolve. - Prof. Jenny Bryan, UBC

<aside class="notes">
* You may have seen this on projects
    * I have, e.g. AH "the number"
* "Many people who don't use `git` unwittingly re-invent a poor man's version of it."
* Manual vc != good
* So we need an automated solution - enter `git`
</aside>

## What is `git`? {data-background="www/git-bg.jpg"}

* Free
* Built for collaboration
* Distributed

<aside class="notes">
* Free as in Â£, free as in open source
* Collaborative - enables many people to work on the same project code
    * Or just you and future-you
* Distributed - every "developer" has a complete history of the code
* Not just for code, anything that is _stored as_ text (e.g. Markdown not Word!)
can be controlled
</aside>

## What is `git` for us?

* Better collaboration
* Better reproducibility
* Better version control - "track changes on steroids"
* Better audit trails

![brent](www/brent.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Tools for collaboration, easily get your + colleagues work, review it, change
it, enhance it etc
* Get the code, understand the history, reproduce the results
* go back and forward in time
* get the code at a specific point in time
* View changes, comment on changes, accept/reject/merge

</aside>

## The `git` log

![](www/git-commits-log.png)

A history of _every_ change made to the code.

<aside class="notes">
* git tracks file evolution with a series of _commits_, each with an explanatory
message and unique ID
* gives us a timeline of the whole project
* We can use the messages to understand the changes
* We can use the ID to go backwards and forwards in time
* Built in audit-trail, future-me (and others) can understand
</aside>

## Tracking changes with `git`

![](www/commit-diff.png)

Makes reviewing code very easy

<aside class="notes">
* Red = removed; green = added
* git will summarise one, or a thousand files
* demo jumping back and forth with SourceTree?
</aside>
    

```{r get-logs, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# List out all files to be read in
files_dir <- list.files("./logs", pattern = ".tsv", full.names = T)
files <- gsub(".tsv", "", list.files("./logs", pattern = ".tsv"))

# Define function to read commit tsv (weird formatting prevents read_tsv)
read_commits <- function(commits_data, data_name) {
  readr::read_lines(commits_data) %>% 
    map(stringr::str_split, '\t') %>% 
    map(`[[`, 1) %>% 
    map(t) %>% 
    map(as_tibble) %>% 
    bind_rows() %>% 
    set_names(c("commit", "author", "datetime", "comment")) %>% 
    mutate(version = data_name)
}  

# Read in data
commits <- map2(files_dir, files, read_commits) %>% # Read in
  bind_rows()  # Collapse in to single table

commits_cln <- commits %>% 
  extract(version, "version_number", regex = "([[0-9]]+)", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(datetime = gsub("\\ \\+0000", "", datetime),
         datetime = ymd_hms(datetime),
         date = date(datetime),
         hour = hour(ceiling_date(datetime, unit = "hours")),
         day = wday(date, label = T, abbr = F),
         version_number = as.numeric(version_number),
         author = if_else(author == "Sara young", "Sara Young", author),
         author = if_else(author == "unknown", "Unknown", author)) %>%
  group_by(commit) %>% 
  mutate(earliest_version = min(version_number)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(version_number == earliest_version) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(datetime) %>% 
  separate(version, c("label", "ver"), "_") %>% 
  select(-label) %>% 
  filter(version_number <=  9) %>% 
  mutate(ver = forcats::fct_reorder(ver, datetime, min))
```

## Project Osbourne

```{r commit_versions_vs_date, cache = TRUE}
commits_cln %>% 
  group_by(version_number, date) %>% 
  summarise(commits = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, commits)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = as.factor(version_number)), size = 1.25) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = unname(kpmgcolours("graphs")[1:9])) +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Commits",
       title = "Total commits per date, per build version") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Build version", nrow = 2, byrow = T)) +
  theme_kpmg() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<aside class="notes">
* Osbourne - regulatory calculation & remediation, needed audit trail
* Very messy data, dynamic requirements, tight deadlines
* Each "version" ~200 code files with logic for data cleaning, calculations, test suites etc
* easily jump between them, compare results, asses the impact of changes to script logic
* In DSE versions could be alernative product features/developments, experiments, new data logic
</aside>

## `git` hosting

![bb](www/bb.png)

<aside class="notes">
* GitHub/Stash != git
* Lots of servies offering git _hosting_
* I.e. store a repository on the (private) web
* Within KPMG we use BitBucket - an Atlassian product
* Common open source equivalent is _GitHub_
</aside>

## `git` hosting

![bb2](www/bb2.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Easy way for project overview, without local code
* Restrict access on a project-by-project basis
* Several related products, e.g. Jira and Confluence (also Atlassian) to give us full PM side of work
    * Jira: to do lists, issues, tasks etc
    * Confluence: documentation, articles, longer-form project
* Integrates with markdown - free project website!
    * Especially on GitHub
</aside>

## `git` for me

![gh](www/gh.png)

<aside class="notes">
* GitHub != `git`. _GitHub_ is just another git hosting service
    * I don't pay, so it's public, but there are also paid private/enterprise versions
* I use it for tracking progress of personal projects
    * E.g. work from MSc
    * Personal blog, little projects etc
* Others use it to release software (e.g. the software I wrote the presentation with!)
</aside>

## Why `git`

* _Doing_ integrated with _organising, recording, disseminating, ..._
* Version control & audit trails
* Tools for QA
* Better use of the team
* Faster releases
* Structured collaboration
* Community

<aside class="notes">
* As the team _does_, they are already organising, recording...
* VC, tag, branch, test out new features in isolation (better management of code)
* Tools - diffs, pull requests, merges
    * Senior team discuss changes, junior team treat as QA opportunities
* Team can code "safely" in their own environment & only integrate changes after QA
    * Less time (money) spent integrating & fixing, focus on "doing", QA, and delivering
* Faster -> code, review, release (not a monolith)
* Less overhead as there is "one way" to collab - "enforced" standards
    * Distributed - hard for one person to "break" others' environments; reliable (burn it all down)    
* Community - people know it, less upskilling, better onboarding

## Questions?

![questions](www/questions-largest.gif)

# How `git` works

## Snapshots of files

![git-timeline](www/git-timeline.png)

Stores data as a series of _snapshots_ of a mini file system.

<aside class="notes">
* Talk through picture
* This is different from other systems which store a series of differences
* if a file has not changed, git just point backs in time to most recent version
* git ~ mini file system - gives us the powerful tools for branching etc
    * see `.git` folder when we create a repository
</aside>

## The three areas of git

![areas](www/git-areas.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Working directory - your files, the things you see on your computer
* Staging area - doesn't exist, it's a `git` concept
* `.git` directory - the repository - the "database" that stores the changes and "does git"
* Flow: make changes, `add` to staging area,  `commit` to save as a change
</aside>

## `git`

> Now the bad news: `git` was built neither for the exact usage described here, nor for broad usability. 

<aside class="notes">
* You will undoubtedly notice this so it's best to know in advance. 
* git is massive and complicated
    * but we don't need it all
* But there are many tools and habits that can soften the sharpest edges, and
reduce frustration.
* We will get the most gain for you pain.
    * But really, for not much pain there is a _lot_ of gain to be had
</aside>

## We're aiming to avoid this

* Or heard Dave ranting about git
* Do you ever feel like this?
</aside>

## huh? {data-background="www/confused.gif"}

<aside class="notes">
Don't worry, we'll take it step by step

1. Start with setting up a repository
1. Add some files
1. _Commit_ them to `git`
1. Make some changes
1. Add them
1. Commit them
</aside>

## Some encouragement

* I started with git ~4 years ago
* I had no idea what I was doing
* I still have a lot to to learn
* But, look at me now - this can be you!
</aside>

# Working with `git` commands

## Basic, local `git`

Use:  `git <command>`

* `init`
* `status`
* `add`
* `commit`
* `diff`
* `log`

[Reference](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

## Create a new repository

In SourceTree

* File > New > Create Local Repository
* Choose a location and repository name
    * The location will become your _working directory_
* Click "create"

```
cd path/to/my/project/directory
git init
```

<aside class="notes">
* May need to tell `git` who you are in SourceTree first
* Command is for the command line
* This will create the folder, and inside will be a (hidden) `.git` folder
    * (May need to show hidden folders through control pannel)
* Can do this in folders that have files already
</aside>

## Doing & reviewing work

* Add some files (e.g. the ones I sent)
* These files are now in the _Working Directory_
* Remember, `git` manages code/text files
* See the files in SourceTree
* `status` on the command line shows other useful information

```
git status
```

![status](www/initial-status.png)

<aside class="notes">
* The new files will show up in SourceTree
    * Marked with ? - tells us they are new
* `git status` will show us these files on the command line
* Shows us new files in the _Working Directory_
</aside>

## Adding files to the index

* Right click a file in SourceTree
* Select 'Add to Index'
* Moves files in to the _Staging Area_

```
git add <filename>
git add *
git add *.R
git add *.sql
```

<aside class="notes">
* Remember - staging area is the one that "doesn't exist"
* This is us telling `git` to include these files in the next commit
* Not actually necessary in Mac SourceTree, but I'm showing you here so you get
what's going on
    * Or if you want to work on command line!
</aside>

## Commiting files - saving changes

* Click file(s) in SourceTree (the checkbox)
* Enter a message
* Click "Commit"

```
git commit -m "A message that describes the changes"
```

![git-commit](www/git-commit.png)

<aside class="notes">
* Writes a new entry in the commit timeline
* The message should be an action:
    * "The purpose of this commit is to..."
* If you use the command line - remember to use a message!
</aside>

## Make some changes

* Open, edit, and save the files:
    * dplyr.R: Remove `library(dplyr)`
    * pandas.py: Do nothing
    * select.sql: Add a `where` clause to the `select`
    * readme.md: Add some markdown (e.g. paragraph, couple of bullet points)
    
<aside class="notes">
* Use an editor (even notepad)
* You can make different changes if you want
* Just need something for git to pick up!
</aside>

## See your changes

![g-changes](www/git-changes.png)

You're looking at a `git diff`

```
git diff <filename>
```

<aside class="notes">
* Diff = summary of the changes made to a file
* Green = added
* Red = removed
* Add and commit these changes in the same way as before
</aside>

## View the log

Use the _History_ tab to see the timeline in SourceTree

![log](www/git-log.png)

```
git log
```

<aside class="notes">
* Can view the log on cli with `git log`
* Can see, the commit message, the file(s) which were changed
* _What_ the changes were
* Who made them
* When they were made
</aside>

## Some useful functionality

* _Tag_ a commit (right click > _Tag_): `git tag -a <tag label> -m "<message/description on the tag>"
* Unstage a file (uncheck SourceTree box): `git reset HEAD <file>`
* Undo unstaged changes : `git checkout <file>`

<aside class="notes">
* Easy to do these in SourceTree
* tags are really just labels on commits, useful for marking (e.g.) a release/version
* checkout/reset in SourceTree will _delete_ changes in files, so be careful
    * (but useful if stuff gets messy and easier to wipe out recent history)
* `checkout` is also useful for moving backwards/forwards/sideways in time in
`git`, but we'll talk about that later
</aside>

## Do's and dont's

<br>

> - Do commit code, markdown/text, _small_ data, configs
> - Do add and commit often (even for small changes)
> - Don't commit anything with passwords/access keys in it
> - Don't commit large files (e.g. big `csv`)
> - Don't commit non-text files (e.g. MS Office, strange data formats, pdf)
> - Don't version things manually (e.g. `file_v2`)
    
    
<aside class="notes">
* Commit as much as possible (whilst staying organised and sane) - you never know if you will want to roll back later
* 1 commit per 1 change/group of related changes
    * You can squash commits together later
    * Small commits makes it easy for you to jump around if you need
* DON'T PUT PASSWORDS OR ACCESS KEYS IN TO FILES TRACKED WITH GIT    
* Large files will clog up git
* Binary files cannot be properly managed by git - so don't bother with them
    * If you want MS Word, write in markdown, convert with pandoc
* Manual versioning is not needed with git
    * Keep back up if paranoid, but really, it's not needed
</aside>

## Good to go

![st](www/sunny-thumbs.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* For the basics that's pretty much it
    * For local-only, single-user code base with a simple timeline
* But we probably want more
* One of the first things - collaboration over the 'net
</aside>

# Working with `git` and BitBucket

## Remote `git`

* `git`
    * `clone`
    * `remote`
    * `pull`
    * `fetch`
    * `merge`
    * `push`
* Useful to know the commands, even if you use SourceTree
* Simplest workflow - [centralised remote repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow)

<aside class="notes">
* These are the most basic commands for working with git on a server and
collaborating with others
* Simple workflow
    * 1 central
    * All clone, work
    * Push/pull
* Talk about other workflows later  
</aside>

## General workflow

1. Create a repository on BitBucket
2. Clone the (empty) repository
    * Or link an existing project to the repository on BitBucket
3. Do some work
4. `add`, `commit` changes
5. Share changes back to BitBucket

<aside class="notes">
* Basic way of working with git on a server & collaborating with future self + others
* This does not include branching, pull request etc, come to that later
    * I.e. limited git features, limiting review and full benefits of git hosting
* The repository on BB will be _remote_ (i.e. not local)
    * _remote_ is a git term for a repository we are tracking, but that lives elsewhere
</aside>

## Create a project repository

On BitBucket:

* Navigate to your _project_
* Create a repository (`+`)

<br>

In SourceTree:

* File > New > Create Remote Repository
    * Need to have linked you BB account in SourceTree (Preferences > Accounts)
    * Choose a _project_ to create the repository in
    * Give it a name

<aside class="notes">
* If you create a remote in SourceTree you refer to the project by it's acronym - check BB
* Doesn't do anything on our laptop, just creates a repository on the BB server
* Process is basically the same for working with github, too
</aside>

## Create a personal repository

* Only possible directly on BitBucket (i.e. not SourceTree)
* Navigate to profile
    * https://hdp-service.uk.kworld.kpmg.com/stash/profile
* Click "Create Repository"

<aside class="notes">
* Personal repo is just for you - not associated with a project
* If you _fork_ (see later) a repository it will be personal, too
* Nice for testing out git/bb
</aside>

## Get a repository

In SourceTree:

* File > New > Clone from URL
    * Give it the remote repository URL
    * Set the file path to save the code to
    * (Optionally) change the name (just for SourceTree)
    
```
cd path/to/where/you/want/your/local/repo
git clone <https://url.git> [./into/here]
```

<aside class="notes">
* clone - checkout to get a local copy of the files _and_ the repository (i.e. the commit log)
    * Hence _distributed_
* The the default name for the first remote is "origin"
* Clone the git-testing repo in training-and-testing project on BitBucket
</aside>

## Link your existing work

If you have already done some work _before_ creating a BitBucket repository:

<br>

In SourceTree:

* Right click on "Remotes"
* Click "New Remote" & add details

```
git remote add origin [https://repo-url.git]
```

<aside class="notes">
* Usually better to create BB _then_ work, but can add a remote if we need
* Note in CLI using default name _origin_
    * Can change this to whatever we want
* Can have multiple remotes with different names if we want
</aside>

## Do some work, `add` and `commit`

* Work as usual
* `add`
* `commit`
* Changes are saved in _local_ repository

<aside class="notes">
* We work as normal, making changes, adding and commiting as usual
* All the changes are just saved in our _local_ repository
* We can do what we want, really
    * Our code won't cause "fuck ups" until we share it with others
    * Empowers us to work, experiment, test etc
</aside>

## Update your local copy

* Collaborator(s) update the repository you cloned
* You need to update
* SourceTree > Pull

```
git pull
```

Or maybe:

```
git fetch
git merge
```

![fetch](www/fetch.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Jim to make a change and submit that to the repo
* Full syntax `git pull origin master`
    * Pull from origin into our `master` branch
* Will get the commit log, and overwrite changes in our local file - so be careful
* Safer (what `git pull` does):
    * `git fetch` - get remote commits but don't merge + overwrite
    * `git merge` - overwrite local files with commits we just `fetch`ed
* Should usually be fine to just `git pull`, but if you're worried about
conflicts, `fetch` and `merge` manually
</aside>

## Send in your changes

* `add` and `commit` as usual
* Then SourceTree > Push

```
git push 
```

<br> 

Cannot `git push` before you `git pull`

<aside class="notes">
* Push is used to send our _local_ changes to the _remote_ repository
* Sends the log _and_ the files, so others get the changes and our history
* We can't `push` before we `pull` (if using simple, centralised workflow)
    * Discuss other workflows later
* Things like pull requests are not strictly necessary for the basics, we'll
talk about them later
</aside>

# Branching

## `git` branches

![branch](www/branches.svg)

<aside class="notes">
* Very lightweight, can be used regularly
* Help keep "bits" of code independant
* Can be separated + joined at will
* Default branch is usually called `master`
* Several models for branching, we'll look at a couple
</aside>

## `git` branches

![branch](www/branch.gif)

<aside class="notes">
* Where git can get complicated if we're not careful
* BUT - branches are really just pointers to a commit/series of commits
* Perfectly possible to use branches for simple tasks - keeping various code/versions separate
* Lots of the functionality of branches is probably not that useful for us day-to-day
* So we'll keep it simple
</aside>

## `git` branching commands

* `git`
    * `branch`
    * `checkout`
    * `merge`

<aside class="notes">
* `branch` - used to create new branches, delete branches, see branches
* `checkout` - used to switch between branches (and commits)
* Often easier to use SourceTree/GUI for this instead, but commands are good to know
</aside>

## Creating a branch

* SourceTree > Branch
    * Optionally select a specific commit to branch from

```
git branch [branch name] # Just create
```

<aside class="notes">
* Creates a new label on a commit
    * Either specified or HEAD
* CLI doesn't switch to that branch
* SourceTree will optionally switch to (`checkout`) the new branch
</aside>

## See branches

* SourceTree > Local _or_ Remote > Look! `r emo::ji('eyes')`
* `git branch` - see _local_ branches
* `git branch -r` - see _remote_ branches
* `git branch -a` - see _all_ branches
* `git branch -v` - see branches and most recent commit details

<aside class="notes">
* Commands useful to see what branches there are to get
</aside>

## Switching branches (and commits!)

* SourceTree > Double click branch name
* SourceTree > Double click tag name
* SourceTree > Double click commit

```
git checkout [branch name]
git checkout [tag name]
git checkout [commit hash id]
```

<aside class="notes">
* Switches between different branches/tags/commits
* Switching between branches is quick and usually safe
* If checkout commit/tag, we get warning about 'Detached HEAD'
    * This is (stupid) git-speak for "you're about to set your 'working pointer'
    ("HEAD") to something in the past"
* Switching to commit/tag is usually done to either see the code at that point,
or to get back to an earlier version to branch directly from it
</aside>

## Sharing _your_ branch

* SourceTree > 
    * Push > 
    * Select your new branch

```
git push -u origin [branch name]
```
    
<aside class="notes">
* Make your branch available for other developers
* This may never be necessary: you may branch, work, merge/abandon branch
* Getting others' branch(es) is also easy
</aside>

## Getting someone _else's_ branch

* SourceTree > 
    * Fetch > 
    * Expand remote (`origin`) > 
    * Right click on branch > 
    * Checkout

```
git fetch
git checkout [new branch name]
```

<aside class="notes">
* Useful for getting the branch of another developer
* Again, this might never be needed if they create branches and merge back into
a common branch that you have
</aside>

## Merging branches

Join branches together

![merge](www/merge.jpg)

* SourceTree >
    * Select branch to merge _into_ > 
    * Merge > 
    * Select commit (other branch) to merge

```
git checkout [a branch]
git merge [another branch]
```

<

## Deleting local branches

* SourceTree > 
    * Right-click on branch > 
    * Delete

```
git branch -d [branch name]
```

<aside class="notes">
* Deleting local != deleting remote - they are separate!
* Can delete one but not the other, so be careful what you delete
* Useful if you branched locally but don't need to share it and want a clean
local repo
</aside>

## Deleting remote branches

* SourceTree > 
    * Expand remote > 
    * Right click on branch > 
    * Delete

```
git push origin --delete [branch name]
```

<aside class="notes">
* Take care deleting remote branches, can be tricky 
    * Might not be necessary if they're just local and you don't mind
* Can delete one but not the other, so be careful what you delete

# Workflow & branching models

## Centralised repository

[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow)

* What we've already covered
* One central repo
* Team push to/pull from a single repo

<aside class="notes">
* The simplest model
* Works for most straightforward projects with 1-3 people in close communication
    * E.g. pensions
* Don't need extensive branches
</aside>

## Feature branches

[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

* Still one centralised repo
* One main branch (`master`)
* Create a new branch for each new feature, based on the main branch
* `master` contains the "official" code
* Manage change with _pull requests_

<aside class="notes">
* Simple extension to centralised repo workflow
* Have one "official" history - `master`
* _Everything_ based on `master`
* Pull requests shown later - encourage code reviews
</aside>

## Forking workflow

[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

* Start with a central repo
* Developers _fork_ (UI in BitBucket)
* Many server-side repo's (one per developer)
* Developers commit to their own repo
    * Still use local branching to keep code separate
* Pull requests of code back to the central repo

<aside class="notes">
* Central repo - e.g. in the _project_ space
* Forked repo - in the developer's personal space
* Developers work in isolation
* Pull requests for code review
</aside>

## GitFlow

[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

## Pull requests


# Summary

## What is `git`?

* Better collaboration
* Better reproducibility
* Better version control - "track changes on steroids"
* Better audit trails

<aside class="notes">
* Not GitHub - git is just software
</aside>


## Why `git`

* _Doing_ integrated with _organising, recording, disseminating, ..._
* Version control & audit trails
* Tools for QA
* Better use of the team
* Faster releases
* Structured collaboration
* Community

<aside class="notes">
* As the team _does_, they are already organising, recording...
* VC, tag, branch, test out new features in isolation (better management of code)
* Tools - diffs, pull requests, merges
    * Senior team discuss changes, junior team treat as QA opportunities
* Team can code "safely" in their own environment & only integrate changes after QA
    * Less time (money) spent integrating & fixing, focus on "doing", QA, and delivering
* Faster -> code, review, release (not a monolith)
* Less overhead as there is "one way" to collab - "enforced" standards
    * Distributed - hard for one person to "break" others' environments; reliable (burn it all down)    
* Community - people know it, less upskilling, better onboarding

<aside class="notes">
* But you can do it (I did)
* You can safely ignore large parts of git
    * They're not for us
* There are lots of excellent resources
